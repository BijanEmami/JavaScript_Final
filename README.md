# JavaScript_Final
Final project for an introductory JavaScript class

This is a small final project for my intro to JavaScript class from Spring 2021.  The object of the final was to create a JavaScript “game” that help inform and educate about various techniques used in web development utilizing JavaScript.  The use of proper HTML and CSS techniques was a requirement as well.  Techniques such as creating variables, while loops, for loops, and switch cases were used.  Multiple other techniques as well were a requirement, for example addEventListener, getElementById, querySelector, and querySelectorAll for example.  Creation and implementation of functions was also a focus and requirement of the project.
